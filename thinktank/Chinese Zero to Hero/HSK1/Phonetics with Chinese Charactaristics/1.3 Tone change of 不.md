不 - bù

The tone of bù may change depending on what follows it. If the following tone is the fourth tone - e.g. shì, bù will be pronounced bú.

不懈, 不是 - bú xiè, bú shì
Now has a second tone.

In any other case, bú will stay bú.

However, in a dictionary, the change will not be indicated, as it is only verbal. It will be labelled in a dictionary as bù, e.g. bùshì.
