一 - yī 

It's always labelled with a first tone, but is usually pronounced with a fourth tone (yì.)

It also changes depending on what follows it. It effectively works like [[1.3 Tone change of 不]]. If what follows is a fourth tone, it is pronounced as a second tone (yí.)

yìdìn -> yídìn.

## Exception 1
If in a word, 一 is the last character, it remains in the first tone.

e.g. 星期一 -> xīngqīyī

---

## Exception 2
In a name, phone number, or counting, it will remain in the first tone (yī.)

The only two characters that have tone change rules are 一 and 不.
