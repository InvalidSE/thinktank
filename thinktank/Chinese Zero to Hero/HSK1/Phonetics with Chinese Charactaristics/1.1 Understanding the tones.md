ā -> High flat - **AWE**some
á -> Rising - Huh?
ǎ -> Low flat - Uh...
à -> Falling - Ouch!
a -> Neutral

## The neutral tone
Neutral tone sounds *much lower* than the other tones, *except* when it follows a third tone - it is slightly higher, sounds much closer to a first tone except very short.

--- 

## The third tone (before a pause)
你们好
nǐmen hǎo 

The last third tone rises a lot more. When the third tone is at the end of a sentance or before a long pause, it will rise a lot more. Another example is 对不起 (duìbuqǐ).
